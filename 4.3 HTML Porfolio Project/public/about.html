<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Agatha BÃ©aur, 28-year-old French woman living in Mexico City. 
  Active and curious, the path of life brought me to learn web programmation which I very much like!
  I am a versatile person with a Master Degree in Intertional Business and Foreign Languages.
  Fluent in French, English & Spanish.
</p>

<p>My first steps in the professional world were directed to Sales in different sectors and among them the Tech industry.
  I worked in TheFork (foodTech industry), Astier de Villatte (interior design industry) & IBAI Conssular (construction industry).
  Then I've studied to become an Insurance Broker in Mexico, which I am now.
  Recently I had the opportunity to discover the web development language and it's getting me very excited for my professional career.

<p>I like traveling, that0s why I went to the USA when I was 17 for an Exchange year in Michigan.
  Then I went to Mexico in 2018 to accomplish my last year of Bachelor Degree in Puebla. 
  I finished my Master Degree at the University of Angers in France and then came back to try my professional luck in Mexico.

<p>I like learning things, practicing sports like yoga, hiking, horse back riding, alpine ski, to only cite a few of them. 
  I also spend good times listening to music at home or at festivals. 
  I try to meditate everyday, as well as reading and being useful for the society!
